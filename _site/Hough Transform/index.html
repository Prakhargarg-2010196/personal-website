<p>In this method following steps are undertaken:</p>
<ol>
<li>First the points of known edges in spatial domain[^1]  are taken.</li>
<li>Now as we know these points can be passing through infinite lines. So these points must be valid on some line following the following equation
<code>y = mx + c</code>  , where m : slope of the line and c is the constant.</li>
<li>To apply the Hough transform we must shift the coordinates (x,y) from xy-plane to (c,m) in hough-plane by using the following steps:
<ol>
<li>Put values in <code>c =y-mx</code> and put the (x,y) in this formula.</li>
<li>Put c=0 to get value of m and m=0   to get value of c in obtained relation.</li>
<li>Now we would have the points in hough plane i.e (c1,m1) , (c2,m2) and so on.</li>
<li>Draw the graph of lines passing through these points by taking (0,c) on x and (m,0) on the x and y axis respectively.</li>
<li>If the lines pass and intersect through a singular point then the points initially taken are all on the same edge or line.</li>
<li>Calculate the equation of the intersection point (c,m) by placing the values in <code>y=mx+c</code></li>
<li>You can also cross check for the edge points by placing it in the above equation found.</li>
</ol>
